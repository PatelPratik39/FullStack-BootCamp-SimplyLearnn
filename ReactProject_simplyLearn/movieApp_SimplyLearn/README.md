# React + Vite

Streamify app

- This is simple ReactJS app created using Vite. I have used open source ThirdParty API to get Movies data.
- API : http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=hollywood&apikey=777276aa

- This App is simply fetches the Movie data from the API with actual posters.
- I have used useState and UseEffect hooks.
- for styling :  i have used Bootstrap
- User can simply search for the movie using search field
- user can add the movie as favourite Movie List
- User can remove the moview from favourite Movie list
- I have used localStorgae method to save the movie locally, so each refresh time saved movie wont get remove from list.
